> Work in progress!

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to research TensorFlow for machine vision industrial usage. <br/>
It will provide easy to use methods to train models from scratch and also fine tune them afterwards.

## Use

The "train.py" script is consuming a configuration file (you will find some predefined in "config" folder).

> python src/train.py config/sample.json

## Models
